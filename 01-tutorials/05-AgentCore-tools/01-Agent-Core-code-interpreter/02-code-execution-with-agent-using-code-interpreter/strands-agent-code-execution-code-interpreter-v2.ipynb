      "### **Formulae Used:**\n",
      "1. **Monthly Payment Formula:** M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]\n",
      "2. **Total Payment Formula:** Total Payments = Monthly Payment × Number of Payments  \n",
      "3. **Total Interest Formula:** Total Interest = Total Payments - Principal Amount\n",
      "4. **Future Value of Annuity:** FV = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Financial Metrics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "| Metric | 15-Year (3.4%) | 30-Year (2.75%) |\n",
      "|--------|----------------|------------------|\n",
      "| Monthly Payment | $2,662.43 | $1,530.90 |\n",

      "### **Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The 15-year loan is more suitable for you if you:**\n",
      "- Can comfortably afford the higher monthly payment ($2,662 vs $1,531)\n",
      "- Have stable income (need ~$9,507+ monthly gross income)\n",
      "- Prefer guaranteed savings over investment risk\n",
      "- Want to build equity faster and be debt-free in 15 years\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key advantages of the 15-year option:**\n",
      "- Save $71,887.83 in total interest (19.2% of loan amount)\n",
      "- Own your home outright 15 years sooner\n",
      "- Guaranteed return equivalent to your 3.4% loan rate\n",
      "- Protection against future interest rate increases\n",
      "\n",
      "The 15-year loan provides a clear financial advantage through substantial interest savings and faster equity building, making it the better choice if you have the financial capacity to handle the higher monthly payment."
