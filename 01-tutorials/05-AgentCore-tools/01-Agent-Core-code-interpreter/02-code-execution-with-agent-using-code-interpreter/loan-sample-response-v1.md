# query = "I have a home valued at 500 k, i have 125k that i can put as down payment and in the market to shop for a mortgage. I have two loan offers - a 15 year term at 3.4% rate of interest and a 30 year term at 2.75% rate of interest. Which loan offer is more suitable for me ?"



I'll analyze both mortgage offers by calculating the monthly payments, total interest paid, and other key financial metrics to help you make an informed decision.

## Summary

Based on my analysis of your two mortgage options, here's my recommendation:

**The 15-year loan at 3.40% is likely the better choice** if you can comfortably afford it.

### Key Findings:

**15-Year Loan (3.40%)**
- Monthly payment: $2,662.43
- Total interest: $104,238
- You'll own your home outright in 15 years

**30-Year Loan (2.75%)**  
- Monthly payment: $1,530.90
- Total interest: $176,126
- Lower monthly payment but costs $71,888 more overall

### Why the 15-year loan is typically better:

1. **Guaranteed savings**: You save $71,888 in interest - this is certain, not dependent on market performance
2. **Faster equity building**: You'll own your home 15 years sooner
3. **Forced savings**: Higher payments build wealth through home equity
4. **Lower total cost**: Despite the higher rate, you pay much less overall

### Choose the 30-year loan only if:
- Your income is below $115,000/year (affordability concerns)
- You have high-return investment opportunities (consistently earning 4%+)
- You need the extra $1,131/month for other financial priorities
- You prefer maximum cash flow flexibility

### Bottom Line:
The 15-year loan provides a guaranteed "return" equivalent to avoiding 3.40% interest on $375,000, which is very attractive in today's market. Unless you have compelling reasons for the extra cash flow or exceptional investment opportunities, the 15-year loan builds wealth more effectively.

**Consider your complete financial situation**, including emergency fund, other debts, and investment goals when making your final decision.
